# Module 2: Explore Advance Types of Typescript

- Type assertion
    - I understand type, better than ts (define type using 'as')
- Interface, Type Alias v/s Interface
    - Use Type Alias for Array Type declaration
    - Use Type Alias for Function Type declaration
    - Use Interface for objet Type declaration
    - Use whatever you want just make sure that the code is cleaner and human readable
    - To extend property in interface <code>extends</code> keyword is used
    - Interface can extends both ***Type Alias*** and another *interface*
    - ***Interface*** and ***Type Alias*** both can be mix-matched and will work fine
